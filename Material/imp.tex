On the implementation level, we copy all data into the block at execution time. For temps that are just read, we just copy them and
store them in the context of the block, then all reads to that var read from there.

For vars written, they are allocated in an array and we copy a reference to *that array* when the block is allocated and then we access
the value via that indirection (so if we change it, other blocks that referent to the same var see the change).

So that means: conceptional this is right, but it is a bit bad that the *implementation* does exactly here the opposite :-)
